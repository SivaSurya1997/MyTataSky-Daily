5. After clicking on ```Run Workflow```, A new repository will be created in your account named ```"MyTataSky-Daily"```
<p align="left"><img src="img/6.png" width="280" height="180"></p>

6. Go to the new repository named "MyTataSky-Daily"
7. Now under actions click on ```Run Workflow```
<p align="left"><img src="img/7.png" width="900" height="400"></p>


8. Once the workflow has been successful, Check your GitHub gists [__https://gist.github.com__/```your_git_username```] then click on view your Gists. 
- ```For Example : https://gist.github.com/techiesneh```
9. Now you'll see that you'll have ``` mytatasky.m3u ``` there.

10. Open it by clicking on it, Then tap on raw. Copy that link and then modify the link by removing only the the hashcode token after /raw/ in the URL. 
- ```With HashCode: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/techiesneh/080307665ca52d259a6f12cc387c368e/raw/f92b8598766239056e70cafe2ef42b1369f73eae/test.m3u```   
- ```Without HashCode: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/techiesneh/080307665ca52d259a6f12cc387c368e/raw/test.m3u```

11. There you go, Now use that URL in your Tivimate. And Tivimate will update the playlist automatically once you open the app.

12. ``` Most Important ``` Now you don't need to touch anything, It updates the playlist on it's own everyday and you only need to Update the playlist in Tivimate.
All the steps above are to be done only for once.

<h2>🤡 Explanation on how this works : </h2>

- This works purely on the basis of GitHub Workflow Actions, So a VERY BIG THANKS to GitHub.
- I've created the script where Actions will automatically trigger the workflow everyday for 2:15 AM UTC.
- The tokens, GitHub email and ID are required because we are basically creating another repo and gists with this script using them.
